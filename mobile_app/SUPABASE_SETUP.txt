⚠️ IMPORTANT: Supabase Credentials Needed
==========================================

Before running the app, you need to add your Supabase credentials to the .env file.

📝 Steps:

1. Open this file: mobile_app/.env

2. Copy your credentials from the web project:
   - Location: /Users/rishabsooraj/orchids-projects/food-rescue-manifesto/.env.local
   - You need: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

3. Paste them into mobile_app/.env like this:

   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

4. Save the file

5. Run: flutter pub get && flutter run

✅ That's it! The app will now connect to your Supabase backend.

Note: The .env file is gitignored for security. Never commit credentials to git!
